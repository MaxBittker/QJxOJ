######Goals:
1) How to be a story teller in the ~dig1ta1~ age. Who's doing it well? Where are we headed?

2) Appreciation and context! what is code, how am I already interacting with it, demystification. Online Empowerment
 - how has the internet felt liberating? how has it felt restrictive? 

######Content:

share+discuss some inspirational pieces of innovative story telling
 - podcasts
 - live news dissemination channels
 - data, visualizations, the upshot
 - storify
 - newsdiffs
 - way more examples prepared (help!)

low - energy session to HTML&CSS skills and build a personal website/event page/joke site/ANYTHING, let those with more experience help out others.
 - I build and deploy a small html page with instructions+ links to examples of innovative journalism + resources
 - then everyone else writes their own page, experienced people help out their neighbors.
 - ideally we help everyone get these pages onto github pages, and we make a list of links for everyone to peruse and feel proud <3
